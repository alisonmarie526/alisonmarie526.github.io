Proposed model of affect-based impulsivity. A stressor induces negative affect. Increases in negative affect elicits concomitant changes in circulating levels of norepinephrine and glucocorticoids. GCs enhance DA reativity in NAcc shell and NE + GCs blunt mPFC functioning. Altered functioning in mPFC and NAcc shell result in altered balance of Pavlovian and goal-directed decision systems. Heightened influence of Pavlovian systems on decision-making resulted in heightened influence of reward cues and invigorate pursuit of rewards.

A community sample of 386 adults completed a task assessing impulsivity following an affect induction. In support of our behavioral hypotheses, among participants exposed to the negative affect induction, self-reported negative urgency heightened discounting of future state when choosing a social action late in learning, Î² = 0.41, t(380) = 2.20, p = 0.029.
